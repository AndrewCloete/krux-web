The world is stitched together with RESILIENCE.  Countless stories of resilience thread through the ages – a fundamental expression of our humanity.  What is more, resilience shows up in many forms; it is not a single skill.  Resilience is a complex embodiment of diverse competencies that enable people to thrive in difficulty.  Some seem to be born with it, most have to develop their stores of resilience and grit.

Resilience asks the following questions:  Are you able to persevere when things get difficult?  Do you get back up when life knocks you down?  Can you remain standing when the pressure mounts?  Are you happy to be alive?  Do you know why you are here?

Sebastian Junger, author, filmmaker, war reporter and journalist, said,
> Humans don’t mind hardship.  In fact, they thrive on it.  What they mind is not feeling necessary.  Modern society has perfected the art of making people feel not necessary.  It is time for that to end.

Most of us are aware that our Western world has become digitally invested, convenience-driven, affirmation-dependent, constantly distracted, and risk-averse.  Our lives lack heroism, hardship, and concrete contending.  Yet, untested as we are, the belief that we have the right to be and have anything we desire, permeates.  In reality, our lives are a disillusionment, and the younger generation is angry, self-absorbed, and overcome with anxiety and a sense of hopelessness.  It is, at least in the West, the age of the unresilient, and it has been a while since Christians have shown themselves to be leaders in resilience.

Present times are crying out for Kingdom people who can do hard and holy things.

The question is, what will it take for us to remember the hallowed weight of magnificent responsibility on our lives?  As God’s people – Kingdom dwellers – we enact what already is.  Though there are still battles to be fought, the war really has already been won.  Before long, the Enemy will be finally vanquished, and Christ will return on the clouds to dwell with us again.  Until then, we are the body of Christ in the world, the intersection of heaven and earth – the first fruits of the Kingdom, bringing Eden back.  It is a great calling, one which requires a undeniable measure of stoutness from the people of God.

How then, do we practice resilience, that we may be equal to the holy work before us?

Five aspects of resilience are worthy of attention: Overcoming, Quick Learning, Withstanding, Tears, and the Serious Business of Joy.

# OVERCOMING or The Obstacle is the Way

> All the world is full of suffering.  It is also full of overcoming – Helen Keller

> Adversity introduces us to ourselves – Albert Einstein

> When things are tough, you fight one more round – James J Corbett, World Heavyweight Champion 1892

Human beings are surprisingly well-suited to exertion and hard use.  Something in our make-up longs for challenge and sacrificial service.  In biblical terms, Kingdom dwellers are called to be hard-wearing farmers, soldiers, and athlete; a life of resilience and dedication.  Even so, the world around us concurrently holds an unspoken belief that life should be pleasurable, and discomfort is avoided reflexively.
