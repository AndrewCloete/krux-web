Otto is a musician, writer, and lover of literature. With a master’s degree in English Studies and an established musical discography, he inhabits a world animated by story and layered with metaphor. Otto’s first full-length album, “The Fox and the Furrow” was released in 2015 under the stage alias Oddo Bam. With an overarching theme of pilgrimage, the album has a pensive undercurrent punctuated by rhythmic nuances and interjections of melodic guitar lines. Currently, Otto is working on a new album dealing largely with the theme of resurrection. He lives and works in Stellenbosch, South Africa.
