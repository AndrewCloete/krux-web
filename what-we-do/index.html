Africa, is a place of extraordinary beauty; a confluence of intellect
and imagination. It is a place that sifts, weighs, and unmasks the
crux of our beliefs.</div><br><div><b>KRUX</b> Christian Study Center is a community of Christian
formation tucked in the heart of Stellenbosch. Launched by native
South Africans JB and Corli Krohn in 2015, KRUX disciples young adults
through theological education, mentoring, community, and a unique
focus on the arts.</div></div></div><div class="mx-auto container px-4 lg:w-1/2 pt-10"><h1 class=text-4xl>Why <i>Theological</i> discipleship?</h1><div class="py-6 font-sans text-slate-500"><div>Each week, KRUX offers in-depth study of the Word, followed by lively
discussion and robust engagement with the implications of a living
theology in the real world.</div><br><div>One would expect this kind of theological discipleship to be a natural
outflow of trusting in Christ and the coming of His Kingdom - the
central act of God towards humanity. In reality, discipleship
frequently finds itself marginalised in the Christian enterprise; with
theology mostly banished to the seminary classroom, divorced from
everyday life. The result is unschooled disciples and untested
theologians.</div><br><div>In contrast, orthodox faith demands a Word-birthed and Word-centred
spirituality generating and sustaining a Word-shaped community, yet
well-versed in cultural literacy.</div><br><div class="bg-khaki px-4 py-3 rounded-md my-2 inline-block font-semibold text-xs"><a href=./what-we-do class=text-white>Find a course</a></div></div></div><div class="mt-4 h-[50vh] lg:h-[30vh] bg-window bg-study flex flex-col justify-center"><div class="container px-4 mx-auto font-sans text-slate-200 lg:w-2/3">“… theology is for doxology and devotion—that is, the praise of God and
the practice of godliness. It should therefore be presented in a way
that brings awareness of the divine presence. Theology is at its
healthiest when it is consciously under the eye of God of whom it
speaks, and when it is singing to his glory.” - James Packer</div></div><div class="mx-auto container px-4 lg:w-1/2 pt-10"><h1 class=text-4xl>Why Mentoring?</h1><div class="py-6 font-sans text-slate-500"><div>Mentorship is intrinsic to the mission of KRUX. It is within the
context of relationship that we step into the fullness of our
personhood and redemption in Christ.</div><br><div>Mentoring at KRUX offers an ongoing encounter in faith-friendship that
enables personal transformation in a uniquely powerful way. It is a
constant and dynamic practice, including personal conversation, study
and dialogue, counselling, seminars, and hospitality; responsive to
each individual's needs and challenges, and resting on a continual
theological equipping.</div><br></div></div><div class="mt-4 h-[50vh] lg:h-[30vh] bg-window bg-mentor flex flex-col justify-center"><div class="container px-4 mx-auto font-sans text-slate-200 lg:w-2/3">“God does not want me to mould others into the image that seems good to
me, that is, into my own image. Instead, in their freedom from me God
made other people in God's image. I can never know in advance how God's
image should appear in others. That image always takes on a completely
new and unique form.” - Dietrich Bonhoeffer</div></div><div class="mx-auto container px-4 lg:w-1/2 pt-10"><h1 class=text-4xl>Why Community?</h1><div class="py-6 font-sans text-slate-500"><div>Christ the Hospitable One ate with 'sinners' and welcomed outsiders.
He always offers a place at the table in anticipation of the coming
feast of the Kingdom of God. We believe a deep theological grounding
can only be truly achieved within the context of community. At KRUX, a
foundational stance of hospitality extends an invitation to enter into
community though the ordinary. An open home, meals shared, time given
and conversation work together to create a space in which to wrestle
and to be challenged, to be known, and to be rooted in the Faith.</div></div></div><div class="mt-4 h-[50vh] lg:h-[30vh] bg-window bg-community flex flex-col justify-center"><div class="container px-4 mx-auto font-sans text-slate-200 lg:w-2/3">“It will not be until the transforming power of God is demonstrated in
each of us as a people gathered in Christ that true hospitality may
begin to be shown; for hospitality is not simply what we do; nor is it a
technique; hospitality is the gospel we embody. It is how we welcome
'the other' in our own body, personally and communally.” Clarke Scheibe,
Canadian L'Abri</div></div><div class="mx-auto container px-4 lg:w-1/2 pt-10"><h1 class=text-4xl>Why Culture & the Arts?</h1><div class="py-6 font-sans text-slate-500"><div>The Triune God acts continually in the transformation of culture. As
image-bearers, our imaginative enterprises are to yield to the
purposes of the Spirit.</div><br><div>At KRUX, we support the pivotal role of the Chrisitan community in the
renewal of culture, especially through the redeeming faculties of the
imaginative and the creative. The Arts has the means to clothe the
human struggle with metaphor and lived experience, and beauty works an
'alchemy in the soul' (Hans Urs Von Balthasar), which rouses a desire
to re-appropriate the good and the true.</div><br><div>The Artists' Gathering, an annual highlight, connects artists of faith
from across Southern Africa, and has brought several international
speakers to our shores. Our Artist-in-Residence provides further
engagement with faith and the arts throughout the year.</div></div></div><div class="mt-4 h-[50vh] lg:h-[30vh] bg-window bg-dove flex flex-col justify-center"><div class="container px-4 mx-auto font-sans text-slate-200 lg:w-2/3">“Art is a building block of civilization. A civilization that does not
value its artistic expressions is a civilization that does not value
itself.” Makoto Fujimura</div></div></div></div></body></html>
